				The most demanding projects in the engineering field are electronics projects because they are very common for electronics, instrumentation, biomedical, and electrical engineering students. We all know that life without electricity for a single day we cannot imagine because it has become like a part of our life. So, learning the basic concepts of electronics is very essential as well as beneficial. There are different concepts in electronics which deals with different circuits. The concepts may include resistors, capacitors, diodes, integrated circuits, microcontrollers, etc. This article list electronics projects for engineering students. These projects are very helpful for ECE/EIE/EEE students.
				<br><br>

				We are listing some engineering mini projects that can be presented and designed by students for their exams. These mini projects are applicable for B-Tech/BE engineering students from various streams like Electronics and Instrumentation (EI), Electronics and Communication (ECE), Electrical Engineering (EEE), diploma and so on. Though the electronic circuits may look complex, they are explained in detail along with a circuit diagram, and are explained with links of all devices that are used in the circuit. Please note that these projects are meant for students, hobbyists and enthusiasts.

		<p><u><b>CELL PHONE SIGNAL JAMMER</b></u><br><br>
			Cell phone jammer is an electronic device that blocks transmission of signals between a cell phone and a base station. By using the same frequency as a mobile handset, the cell phone jammer creates strong interference for communication between the caller and receiver. It is effective in blocking transmission of signals from networks including UMTS, 3G, CDMA, GSM and PHS. Hardware requirements are as follows: Capacitors, Transistors, Cables, and Connectors, Diodes, PCB and Breadboards, LED, Transformer/Adapter Push Buttons, Switch, IC, IC Sockets, 555 Timer.

			<p><u><b>SHORT CIRCUIT INDICATOR</u></b><br><br>
			This is one of the basic projects that one can do to improve his/her confidence in electronics project making. Short circuit condition is a condition in which the input terminals of a power supply get in electrical contact with each other causing huge current flow. This leads to very large heat generation which can damage the system and also pose a threat to people nearby it. Thus short circuit condition is necessary to be detected and be attended immediately. Hardware requirements are as follows: Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Cables, and Connectors; Diodes, PCB and Breadboards, LED, Transformer/Adapter, Push Buttons, Switch.

		<p><u><b> CLAP BASED FAN SWITCHING SYSTEM  </b></u><br><br>
			Automatic switching system are nowadays very popular in domestic as well as industrial scenario. In this project we have a DC fan connected to the system. The system is configured in such a way that by a particular action of the user ‘Clapping’ can cause the Fan to start and remain ON for a limited period of time.We have mic that acts as a transducer. This transducer converts the sound energy in its vicinity to electrical pulses. These pulses are amplified and given to 555 timer controller. If someone claps near the mic of the system the above stated series of events get triggered. This leads to turning ON of the Fan. Hardware requirements are as follows: DC Fan, 555 Timer, IC, Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Cables, and Connectors, Diodes, PCB, and Breadboards, LED Transformer/Adapter, Push, Buttons, Switch, IC, IC Sockets.

		<p><u><b>  FIRE DETECTION ALARM </b></u><br><br>
			No smoking zones are meant to ensure smoke free areas which promote good health and well being. Especially in public places no smoking zones ensure smoke free environment for people and children. But it is not feasible to manually monitor these zones to ensure a smoke free environment and an automated system is required to ensure this. Here we propose a fully automated smoking zone alerting monitoring system to sound an alarm in case a smoker is detected in a smoking zone. The system uses a combination of smoke sensing with 555 timer IC circuitry to ensure this purpose. Hardware requirements are as follows: Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Cables, and Connectors, Diodes, PCB, and Breadboards, LED, Transformer/Adapter, Push, Buttons, Switch, IC, IC Sockets, Tempertaure sensor.

		<p><u><b> AUTOMATIC RAIN SENSING WIPER  </b></u><br><br>
			You have seen Automatic Wiper System in luxury cars where Windshield Wiper automatically gets activated when there is Rain or if there is some water on the windshield. Electronic Wiper is very common device that is attached in every car to wipe the water on the windshield during the rain. But generally they are manually operated and we need to switch them ON manually. But today we are going to build Automatic Rain Sensing Car Wiper System using 555 Timer IC. This circuit automatically detects the rainfall and activates the wiper to clear the windscreen.Hardware requirements are as follows:Rain Drop Sensor, Servo Motor, Crystal Oscillator, Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Cables, and Connectors, Diodes, PCB, and Breadboards, LED Transformer/Adapter, Push Buttons, Switch, IC, IC Sockets, Arduino Compiler.

		<p><u><b>  Fingerprint Bank Locker </b></u><br><br>
			The fingerprint based bank locker system is an enhancement to the traditional bank locker system that uses keys. Now keys can easily be copied and made by theives who know about it. Also the keys must be taken care of and can also be lost due to some negligence. Well fingerprint based bank locker system is here to solve all these issues.The fingerprinted authenticated bank locker system is safe as well as easy to use and maintain.No key handling no need to worry about key getting lost. The system uses fingerprint sensing to read fingerprints and first store registered fingerprints against the bank locker record. Now next time a person scans finger the sensor reads it and compares it with past records. Hardware requirements are as follows: Fingerprint, Sensor, Buzzer, Bank, Locker Door, LCD Display, Crystal Oscillator, Resistors, Capacitors, Transistors, Cables, and Connectors, Diodes, PCB and Breadboards, LED Transformer/Adapter, Push Buttons Switch, IC.
