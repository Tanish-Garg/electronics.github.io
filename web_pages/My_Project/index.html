                The electronics industry saw growth in the early years of the 21st century, encouraged both by government
                policies and incentives and by international investment. Its key and most resource-intensive segment, the semiconductor
                industry benefitted from domestic demand growing briskly. Semiconductors were required by a large number of industries,
                including telecommunications, information technology, industrial machinery and automation, medical electronics,
                automobile, engineering, power and solar photovoltaic, defense and aerospace, consumer electronics, and appliances.
